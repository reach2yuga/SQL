=> DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column when no value is specified during the insertion of a record.
=> This ensures that the column has a valid entry even if data isn't provided, thereby maintaining data integrity.
=> This constraint is useful for setting common or expected values, avoiding NULL values, or ensuring consistent data entries.

-------------------------------------------------

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 50000.00
);

=> if you insert a new employee record without specifying the salary, the column will automatically be set to 50000.00
---------------------------------------------------

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name)
VALUES (1, 'John');

=> Since no salary is provided, John's salary will default to 50000.00.
